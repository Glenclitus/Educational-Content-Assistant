I'm excited to share the first commit of my new project: Educational Content Assistant 🎓🚀

What it does
- Helps educators and content creators generate lesson plans, quizzes, and adaptive learning paths using modular templates and LLMs.

Why I'm building it
- To speed up course creation and help teachers craft better learning experiences.

Next milestone
- Add LLM integration and the Adaptive Learning Path Generator (first demo in 2 weeks).

Follow along — I'll be sharing progress and technical learnings!
